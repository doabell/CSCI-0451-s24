  header: Introduction to Classification
  summary: |
    We introduce the core idea of a classifier as a function that accepts predictors and returns a prediction for a target. We then begin to work through the basic data manipulation and classification via the <code>pandas</code> and <code>scikit-learn</code> packages for Python.

  header: Decision Boundaries and Features
  summary: |
    We learn more about how to visualize and evaluate the behavior of models. We also learn how to learn *nonlinear* decision boundaries by constructing nonlinear features.
