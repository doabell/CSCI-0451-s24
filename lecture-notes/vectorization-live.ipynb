    "So far in this course, we've considered the general *supervised learning* scenario, in which we are given a feature matrix $\\mX \\in \\R^{n\\times p}$ and a target vector $\\vy \\in \\R^n$. We then solve the empirical risk minimization problem in order to choose model parameters that minimize a loss function on the training data. The exact structure of this loss function depends on things like whether we are doing classification or regression, what our computational resources are, and other considerations. \n",
    "\n",
    "But feature matrices $\\mX$ and target vectors $\\vy$ don't just exist in the world: they are *collected* and *measured*. We can think of data collection and measurement as posing three fundamental questions: \n",

    "\n",
    "**Vectorization** is the act of assigning to each data observation a vector $\\vx$, thus forming a feature matrix $\\mX$. Formally, a **vectorization map** is a function $v:\\cD\\rightarrow \\R^p$ such that, if $d \\in \\cD$ is a data observation, then $\\vx = v(d)$ is a set of features corresponding to $d$. \n",

    "The reason that vectorization is necessary is that **machine learning models only understand numbers**. So, if our data *isn't* numbers, we need to convert it into numbers in order to use it for modeling. \n",

    "\n",
    "Most of it! \n",
    "\n",
    "- If your data comes to you as a table or matrix containing only numbers, in which each row corresponds to exactly one observation, then you may not need to vectorize. \n",
    "- If your data comes to you in *any other form*, then you need to vectorize. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some data that usually require vectorization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Images\n",
    "- Text\n",
    "- Audio files\n",
    "- Most genomic data\n",
    "- Etc. etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are tons of ways of vectorizing different kinds of data, and we're not going to cover all of them. Instead, we're going to go a little more in depth on **text vectorization**. We'll discuss image vectorization much more when we get to convolutional neural networks.
