        "The image classification problem is the problem of assigning a label to an image. For example, we might want to assign the label \"duck\" to pictures of ducks, the label \"frog\" to pictures of frogs, and so on. \n",
        "\n",
        "In more practical terms, we might be interested in classifications like: \n",
        "\n",
        "1. \"**cancerous**\" vs. \"**noncancerous**\" X-ray images. \n",
        "2. \"**contains pedestrian**\" vs. \"**no pedestrian**\" optical sensors in driver-assist vehicles. \n",

        "### Ethics of Image Classification\n",
        "\n",
        "Image classification, and application of machine learning tools to visual data more generally, is an area fraught with ethical challenges. Just a few highlights of what can go wrong: \n",
        "\n",
        "1. The famous [GenderShades study](http://gendershades.org/) by Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru found significant racial disparities in the accuracy of face-based gender classifiers. \n",
        "2. Researchers at Stanford [trained a model](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/07/new-artificial-intelligence-can-tell-whether-youre-gay-or-straight-from-a-photograph) on images from a dating site in order to make face-based predictions about an individual's sexual orientation, with higher-than-human accuracy. They argued that their paper supported the idea the sexual orientation is physiologically-influenced and therefore not a choice, but rather something that people are born with. On the other hand, critics raised concerns about the consequences of such a tool being used by oppressive governments in which queer identities and sexuality are prohibited and punished. \n",
        "3. A controversial study from 2016 claimed to be able to predict whether or not an individual would go on to commit a future crime from their facial features. In fact, the researchers allowed themselves to be fooled by a relic of their data collection process: their training data set of non-criminals was from online profile pictures (in which smiling is common), while their training data set of convicted criminals was mugshots, in which smiling is prohibited. So, they essentially built a smile-detector, which has some interest but not for the intended purpose. Here is [one writeup of this episode](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2114900-concerns-as-face-recognition-tech-used-to-identify-criminals/). The idea that it is possible to make inferences about a person's character, abilities, or future decisions is called [*physiognomy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiognomy), and was one of the main \"scientific\" \"justifications\" of the scientific racism movement of the late 1800s and early 1900s. \n",

For this reason, they are often decent at many tasks, but are often outperformed by networks with more specialized layeres that are adapted to the specifics of the task at hand. Image data, for example, is *spatial*. In order to address the spatial nature of images, it is useful to incorporate layers that explicitly account for spatial structure. \n",

We define a square *kernel matrix* containing some numbers, and we \"slide it over\" the input data. At each location, we multiply the data values by the kernel matrix values, and add them together. Here's an illustrative diagram:\n",
