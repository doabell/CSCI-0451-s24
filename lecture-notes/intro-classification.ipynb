    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we'll make our first acquaintance to the *classification* task. Classification is a form of *supervised* machine learning. Here's the big-picture version of the supervised ML task. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are given: \n",
    "\n",
    "- A set of observations of **predictor variables**. We'll call the $i$th such observation $\\mathbf{x}_i$. We write it this way because $\\mathbf{x}_i$ is usually a *vector* of multiple variables, often called *features* or *covariates*. We often collect these observations into a matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$, where $n$ is the number of observations and $p$ is the total number of features. \n",
    "- A set of observations of a single **target variable**. We'll call the $i$th such observation $y_i$. We write it this way because (at least in this course) $y_i$ will always be a scalar number, rather than a vector. We can collect these observations into a (column) vector $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. \n",
    "- We can refer to a single observation as a pair $(\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Big picture, the supervised machine learning task is to use $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ to find a function $f:\\mathbb{R}^p \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ with the property that \n",

    "for *new* observations $(\\mathbf{x}, y)$. We can think of the function $f$ as an expression of the (unknown) *relationship* between the features $\\mathbf{x}$ and the target $y$. If we can find an approximation of that pattern, then we'll have the ability to make predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We often use $\\hat{y} = f(\\mathbf{x})$ to denote the predicted value for $y$ based on $\\mathbf{x}$. So, we want to choose $f$ so that $\\hat{y} \\approx y$. \n",

    "## Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the vector $\\mathbf{y}$ to hold our observations of the target variable. We have assumed that each observation of the target variable is a real number (i.e. an element of $\\mathbb{R}$). This looks reasonable for when the thing we want to predictive is a real number (like a stock price or a probability to like a post), but what about when we want to predict a categorical label? In this case, we can simply encode labels using integers: $0$ for one category, $1$ for the next category, $2$ for the one after that, and so on. \n",

    "## The COMPAS Recidivism Prediction Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Criminal *recidivism* occurs when a person is convicted of a crime, completes the legal terms of their punishment, and is then convicted of *another* crime after release. In the American penal system, predictions of recidivism play a role in determining whether or not a defendant will be released on bail before trial or granted parole after serving a portion of a prison sentence. In other words, the belief of the court about whether a person is *likely to commit a future crime* can have concrete consequences for that person's current and future freedom. Of course, it's difficult for a human to predict whether a defendant is likely to commit a future crime. Furthermore, humans are subject to bias. Wouldn't it be nice if we could use a machine learning algorithm to make this prediction for us? \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, the journalism website [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/) published an [investigative story](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) on COMPAS, a machine learning algorithm used to predict recidivism in Broward County, Florida. They obtained data for criminal defendants in Broward County in the years 2013 and 2014. These data include the COMPAS predictions, as well as demographic information (like age, gender, and race) and legal information (e.g. the crime with which the defendant was charged). The data also include an indicator of whether or not the defendant went on to be arrested of a crime within the two years following their initial trial. \n",
    "\n",
    "[The COMPAS algorithm actually uses information about the defendant beyond what is shown in this table; here is [an example](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2702103-Sample-Risk-Assessment-COMPAS-CORE.html) of the survey used for COMPAS to form its prediction.]{.aside}\n",
