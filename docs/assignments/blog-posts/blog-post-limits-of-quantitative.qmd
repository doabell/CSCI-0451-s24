### What You Should Do

Quantitative methods for assessing discrimination and bias include things like: 

- Formal (mathematical) definitions of bias and fairness in terms. 
- Audits of machine learning algorithms, including things like confusion matrices and false positive rates. 
- Statistical tests of significance for effects related to race, gender, or other protected attributes. 

In a recent speech, @narayanan2022limits [p. 25] asserts that 

> "currently quantitative methods are primarily used to justify the status quo. I would argue that they do more harm than good."

In a carefully-structured essay of approximately 1,500 words, engage **at least 5 scholarly sources** (in addition to Narayanan's speech) to discuss this claim. Your essay should include: 

1. A careful explanation of Narayanan's position. 
2. A careful explanation of the *uses* or *benefits* of quantitative methods, as described in one of your scholarly sources. 
3. Appropriate supporting points from your other scholarly sources. 
4. An argument in which you stake out a position on Narayanan's point of view. Do you agree? Disagree? Agree with qualifications? Which ones? Why? 

### References in Quarto

To manage references in Quarto, you need to create a `.bib` file (you can call it `refs.bib`). This file should live in the same directory as your blog post. Your `.bib` file is essentially a database of document information. Here's an example of a a `refs.bib` file: 

```bibtex
@article{hardt2021patterns,
  title  = {Patterns, predictions, and actions: A story about machine learning},
  author = {Hardt, Moritz and Recht, Benjamin},
  journal= {arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.05242},
  year   = {2021}
}

@article{kearns1994toward,
  title     = {Toward Efficient Agnostic Learning},
  author    = {Kearns, Michael J and Schapire, Robert E and Sellie, Linda M},
  journal   = {Machine Learning},
  volume    = {17},
  pages     = {115--141},
  year      = {1994},
  publisher = {Citeseer}
}

@misc{narayanan2022limits,
  author       = {Narayanan, Arvind},
  howpublished = {Speech},
  title        = {The limits of the quantitative approach to discrimination},
  year         = {2022}
}
```

The simplest way to get entries for your references is to look them up on Google Scholar. 

1. Search for the document you want. 
2. Click the "Cite" link underneath and choose "Bibtex" from the options at the bottom. 
3. Copy and paste the contents of the new page to your `refs.bib` file. 

Once you've assembled your references, add the following line to your document metadata (the stuff in the top cell of your Jupyter notebook)

```yml
bibliography: refs.bib
```

Once you've followed these steps, you're ready to cite! You can reference your documents using the \@ symbol and their bibliographic key, which is the first entry for each document in the `refs.bib` file. For example, typing 

```
@hardt2021patterns
```

results in the reference 

@hardt2021patterns

as well as an entry in the "References" section at the end of your blog post.
