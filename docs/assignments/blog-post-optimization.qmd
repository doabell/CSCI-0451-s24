description: |
    In this blog post, you'll implement several <i>first-order methods</i>: optimization algorithms based on the gradients of functions. You'll implement simple gradient descent, a momentum method, and stochastic gradient descent, comparing their performance for training logistic regression. 
objectives: 
  - Theory
  - Implementation
  - Experimentation
