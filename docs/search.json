    "text": "In this lecture, we’ll make our first acquaintance to the classification task. Classification is a form of supervised machine learning. Here’s the big-picture version of the supervised ML task.\nWe are given:\n\nA set of observations of predictor variables. We’ll call the \\(i\\)th such observation \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\). We write it this way because \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) is usually a vector of multiple variables, often called features or covariates. We often collect these observations into a matrix \\(\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of observations and \\(p\\) is the total number of features.\nA set of observations of a single target variable. We’ll call the \\(i\\)th such observation \\(y_i\\). We write it this way because (at least in this course) \\(y_i\\) will always be a scalar number, rather than a vector. We can collect these observations into a (column) vector \\(\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\).\nWe can refer to a single observation as a pair \\((\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\\).\n\nBig picture, the supervised machine learning task is to use \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) to find a function \\(f:\\mathbb{R}^p \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) with the property that\n\\[\nf(\\mathbf{x}) \\approx y\n\\]\nWhat does it mean for \\[f(\\mathbf{x}) \\approx y\\]? This requires mathematical fleshing-out that we’ll do very soon.\nfor new observations \\((\\mathbf{x}, y)\\). We can think of the function \\(f\\) as an expression of the (unknown) relationship between the features \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and the target \\(y\\). If we can find an approximation of that pattern, then we’ll have the ability to make predictions.\nWe often use \\(\\hat{y} = f(\\mathbf{x})\\) to denote the predicted value for \\(y\\) based on \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). So, we want to choose \\(f\\) so that \\(\\hat{y} \\approx y\\).\n© Phil Chodrow, 2023"

    "text": "Classification\nWe use the vector \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) to hold our observations of the target variable. We have assumed that each observation of the target variable is a real number (i.e. an element of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)). This looks reasonable for when the thing we want to predictive is a real number (like a stock price or a probability to like a post), but what about when we want to predict a categorical label? In this case, we can simply encode labels using integers: \\(0\\) for one category, \\(1\\) for the next category, \\(2\\) for the one after that, and so on."

    "section": "The COMPAS Recidivism Prediction Algorithm",
    "text": "The COMPAS Recidivism Prediction Algorithm\nCriminal recidivism occurs when a person is convicted of a crime, completes the legal terms of their punishment, and is then convicted of another crime after release. In the American penal system, predictions of recidivism play a role in determining whether or not a defendant will be released on bail before trial or granted parole after serving a portion of a prison sentence. In other words, the belief of the court about whether a person is likely to commit a future crime can have concrete consequences for that person’s current and future freedom. Of course, it’s difficult for a human to predict whether a defendant is likely to commit a future crime. Furthermore, humans are subject to bias. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could use a machine learning algorithm to make this prediction for us?\nIn 2016, the journalism website ProPublica published an investigative story on COMPAS, a machine learning algorithm used to predict recidivism in Broward County, Florida. They obtained data for criminal defendants in Broward County in the years 2013 and 2014. These data include the COMPAS predictions, as well as demographic information (like age, gender, and race) and legal information (e.g. the crime with which the defendant was charged). The data also include an indicator of whether or not the defendant went on to be arrested of a crime within the two years following their initial trial.\nThe COMPAS algorithm actually uses information about the defendant beyond what is shown in this table; here is an example of the survey used for COMPAS to form its prediction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity\n\n\n\nHere are three concepts:\n\nDemographic data and legal information related to a defendant.\nWhether or not the defendant proceeds to be arrested for a crime within the two years following their initial trial.\nThe COMPAS algorithm.\n\nMatch these three concepts to the three mathematical symbols in the relationship\n\\[f(\\mathbf{x}) \\approx y\\].\n\n\nLet’s look at an excerpt of the data that ProPublica obtained.

The strongest version of this assumption is that our data are linearly separable. This means that there exists a vector \\(\\mathbf{w} \\in p\\) and a constant \\(w_0\\) such that, for every \\(i\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_i &= \\begin{cases} 0 & \\langle \\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{x}_i \\rangle < w_0 \\\\\n                     1 & \\langle \\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{x}_i \\rangle \\geq w_0\n      \\end{cases} \\\\\n    &= \\mathbb{1}(\\langle \\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{x}_i \\rangle \\geq w_0)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nHere’s an example of what our data might look like. For visualization purposes, we are going to have \\(p = 2\\) features.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\n\nnp.random.seed(12345)\n\nn = 100\np_features = 3\n\nX, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 100, n_features = p_features - 1, centers = [(-1.7, -1.7), (1.7, 1.7)])\n\nfig = plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = y)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"Feature 1\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"Feature 2\")\n\n\n\n\nYou may be able to visualize a line that separates all the purple “0” labels from the yellow “1” labels. Our end-goal is a Python class that will allow us to find such a separating line, when it exists."

If p is a Perceptron, then after p.fit(X, y) is called, p should have an instance variable of weights called w. This w is the vector \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{w}} = (\\mathbf{w}, -w_0)\\) in the classifier above. Additionally, p should have an instance variable called p.history which is a list of the evolution of the score over the training period (see Perceptron.score(X, y) below.)\nPerceptron.predict(X) should return a vector \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\in \\{0,1\\}^n\\) of predicted labels.

Some blog posts will ask you to critically discuss recent readings in an essay-like format.\n[your response here]\n\n\nCourse Presence (Participation)\nYou make a choice each day about how to show up for class: whether you’ll be prepared, whether you’ll engage with me and your peers in a constructive manner; and whether you’ll be active during lecture and discussions. We will also have a special opportunity this semester to engage with a renowned expert in machine learning, algorithmic bias, and the ethics of artificial intelligence.\nAn especially important form of course presence is the daily warmup. We’ll spend the first 10-15 minutes of most class periods on warmup activities. You’re expected to have prepared the warmup activity ahead of time (this means you’ll need to have completed the readings as well). Each time, we’ll sort into groups of 5-6 students, and one of you (randomly selected) will be responsible for presenting the activity on the whiteboard. If you’re not feeling prepared to present the activity, you can “pass” to the next person, or ask for help along the way.\n[your response here]\n\n\nProject\nTo finish off the course, you’ll complete a long-term project that showcases your interests and skills. You’ll be free to propose and pursue a topic. My expectation is that most projects will move significantly beyond the content covered in class in some way: you might implement a new algorithm, study a complex data set in depth, or conduct a series of experiments related to assessing algorithmic bias in a certain class of algorithm. You’ll be expected to complete this project in small groups (of your choosing), and update us at a few milestones along the way.\nPlease share a bit about what kind of topic might excite you, and set a few goals about how you plan to show up as a constructive team-member and co-inquirer (see the ideas for some inspiration).\n[your response here]"

Increasingly, open problems in science and engineering require multiple skill sets and areas of expertise. Because of this, the need to collaborate will only increase in the future. This is why several of CS@Midd’s learning goals are explicitly focused on communication and collaboration. We want our students to have strong professional and communication skills, to be able to function well as part of a team, and to be able to work and communicate with diverse groups of people."

    "section": "Collaborating on Homework and Other Individually-Assessed Assignments",
    "text": "Collaborating on Homework and Other Individually-Assessed Assignments\n\n(COLLABORATION IS A LIFE SKILL) Understand that working with others and asking for assistance are not signs of weakness or deficiency; rather, they are essential life skills important for making progress in any discipline, including computer science. Our department wants you to develop these skills. If you’re too shy to come to my office hours or to join a group of people working on their homework, ask a friend to come with you.\n(COLLABORATIONS BENEFIT FROM DIVERSITY) Open yourself up to working with people whom you don’t know (yet). You might find someone you work really well with and who doesn’t think exactly like you do. A wide range of experiecnes and backgrounds is beneficial in problem solving, although it may be helpful to find folks who can work on assignments during the same time of day and at roughly the same pace. If you’re having trouble finding people to work with, I can help!\n(COLLABORATIONS ARE INCLUSIVE) Believe that everyone has something meaningful to contribute (you included), and that you have something to learn from each person. This can be a difficult state of mind to achieve, but critical for healthy, effective collaboration. Here are some practical consequences:\n\nIn any group setting, listen carefully for everyone’s contributions. Don’t dismiss or ignore what someone says, and don’t move on until you’ve considered it carefully. If what is said doesn’t make sense to you, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s incorrect–the person might just have a way of approaching the problem that is different and not yet clear to you. Furthermore, even ideas that ultimately turn out to be incomplete or incorrect are often still useful building blocks towards a successful approach.\nFind ways to verbally validate the ideas of others. For example: “One really neat feature of Zenith’s approach to part (b) is that it also works with a small modification for part (c).”\nIf someone in the group hasn’t spoken for a while, ask for their ideas or opinions. Conversely, if you find yourself talking a lot, take a step back and allow someone else to contribute to the discussion.\n\n(COLLABORATIONS REQUIRE PREPARATION) Don’t seek help from others on a probem before you’ve had time to think about it yourself, try at least one approach, and formulate the obstacle as clearly as you can. But at the same time, if you find yourself frustrated with a problem and you’re not making progress, don’t wait too long before you look for help from your classmates, your tutors, or me.\n(COLLABORATIONS GENERATE DEEPER UNDERSTANDING) Don’t be satisfied with only producing the correct final result; use your collaboration to push each other to understand:\n\nWhy does this approach work?\nWhat alternative approaches would also have worked?\nWhat are some of the merits and drawbacks of these different approaches?\n\n(COLLABORATIONS ARE EMPOWERING) Good collaborations empower people towards further growth.\n\nWhen you’re working on a problem with others and you find a path before everyone else, avoid ruining the experience of discovery for others. Conversely, if you haven’t figured out something yet and want to enjoy the discovery for yourself, don’t let someone else ruin your joy.\nIf someone asks you for help, don’t just tell them the answer or start showing them a solution method. Listen carefully to their question. Ask for more information if they aren’t being specific enough. If they say “I don’t know where to start,” ask them to tell you about their understanding of what the question is asking and which parts of it seem most puzzling. Ask guiding questions to help them discover ideas for themselves. In these situations, you have the opportunity to learn how to help others learn – this is an invaluable life skill.\n\n(COLLABORATIONS ACKNOWLEDGE CONTRIBUTORS) Whenever you’ve received help on a homework assignment from a classmate, a friend, a tutor, or me, acknowledge the support and briefly describe how it helped you in your assignment.\n\nThe reason I ask you to acknowledge tutors and myself is actually different from the reason I ask you to acknowledge classmates and friends. For classmates and friends, it’s about cultivating transparency and integrity. The primary reason I want you to acknowledge tutors and myself is that the exercise of explicitly remembering and reflecting on your learning journey is part of metacognition, a valuable set of practices that will help you succeed in this class, in college, and in your long-term career."

When, where, and how often will you meet? How can you reach each other in case of an emergency?\n(COLLABORATION IS NOT DIVISION OF LABOR) Collaboration is not the same as splitting up a problem into pieces and then slapping the completed pieces together.\n\nIdentify the parts of the problem that need to be completed together and the parts that can be completed individually.\nWork toward a final product that everyone is happy with and that represents the contributions of everyone on the group.\nDon’t just divide up the work based on who might have the most experience or skill with each part of the problem. Let those who want to develop their skills also have a chance to work on pieces that are unfamiliar to them\n\n(COLLABORATIONS ARE EQUITABLE) Aim for each person to contribute a fair and equitable amount of effort and/or time to the group’s deliverables.\n(COLLABORATIONS RESOLVE CONFLICT QUICKLY) Resolve any misunderstands between the team members quickly. Don’t let those misunderstandings fester into distrust, resentment, or anger. Don’t be afraid to ask your professor for help in resolving interpersonal conflict in your team. While this can feel uncomfortable, often these kinds of situations are important opportunities for everyone to learn more about how to coexist as collaborative, whole humans."

When you turn in such an assignment, you implicitly represent that work as work that you are able to complete yourself under the stated conditions (which may include getting help or working with others). If you cannot complete some work under the stated collaboration conditions, it is dishonest to turn in that work.\nWhen working individually, it is your responsibility to uphold the Code’s standards of integrity and academic honesty. When working in a group, it is additionally your responsibility to ensure that your group as a whole upholds these standards.\nIf you have a question about whether some form of collaboration is permitted, just ask!\n\nWhat Happens if I Observe an Honor Violation?\n\nWe all fail to uphold our highest moral aspirations at times. If you show lack of integrity or academic honesty, that doesn’t mean you’re a bad person. It means that you’re under pressure and chose the course of action that looked like the most workable one to you at the time.\nThat said, if you show lack of integrity or academic honesty, that’s an indicator that you have an opportunity for some very important growth.\nIt is part of my job to help you achieve that growth. I take this part of my job very seriously. In order to help you on your journey, I will connect both of us with the Middlebury Community Standards Office. Office leadership will help us all find a path that helps you grow toward integrity and honesty.\nThis is an awkward and uncomfortable process for everyone involved. You don’t want this."

On the other hand, the probability of a rapid test giving a positive result for an individual who truly does not have COVID-19 is 5%. Suppose that approximately 4% of the population are currently infected with COVID-19. These numbers are mostly made-up.Example 2.3.1 of Murphy, page 46, has a good review of the relevant probability and the definition of each of the rates below.\nWrite a Python function called rate_summary that prints the following output, filling in the correct values for each of the specified rates:\ns = 0.8           # test sensitivity\nf = 0.02          # probability of positive test if no COVID\nprevalence = 0.05 # fraction of population infected\n\nrate_summary(s, f, current_infection)\nThe true positive rate is ___.\nThe false positive rate is ___.\nThe true negative rate is ___. \nThe false positive rate is ___. \n\n\nPart 2\n\nSuppose that scientists found an alternative rapid test which had a 75% sensitivity rate with a 0% chance of a positive test on someone who is truly not infected. Would you suggest replacing the old rapid tests with these alternative tests? Why? \nWhat if the alternative test had an 85% sensitivity rate and a 10% chance of a positive test on someone who is truly not infected?\n\nYou don’t necessarily need to use your function from the previous part in this part.\n\n\nPerceptron\n\nPart 1\nSketch the line in \\(\\R^2\\) described by the equation\n\\[\n\\bracket{\\vw, \\vx}  =  w_0\\;,\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(\\vw = \\paren{1, -\\frac{1}{2}}^T \\in \\R^2\\) and \\(w_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n\nPart 2\nWrite a quick Python function called perceptron_classify(w, w_0, x). w and x should both be 1d numpy arrays of the same length, and w_0 should be a scalar. Your function should return 0 if \\(\\bracket{\\vw, \\vx} < w_0\\) and 1 if \\(\\bracket{\\vw, \\vx} \\geq w_0\\).

Let’s allow \\(\\vx\\) and \\(\\vw\\) to both be \\(n\\)-dimensional, so that this equation defines a hyperplane in \\(\\R^n\\). Suppose that we wanted to represent the same hyperplane in \\(\\R^n\\) using an equation of the form\n\\[\n\\bracket{\\tilde{\\vw}, \\tilde{\\vx}} = 0\\;.\n\\tag{2}\\]\nfor some \\(\\tilde{\\vw} \\in \\R^{n+1}\\).

Grades (and institutional rankings) are currency for a capitalist system that reduces teaching and learning to a mere transaction. Grading is a massive co-ordinated effort to take humans out of the educational process.\n\nI’d prefer to just not give you grades at all.

Blog posts usually involve: written explanation of some relevant theory; implementation one or more algorithms according to written specifications; performing experiments to test the performance of the implementations; and communicating findings in a professional way. Some blog posts will be more like short essays than problem sets or programming assignments. Your blog posts will be hosted on your own public website (which you will create). This website will serve as your portfolio for the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject\n\n\n\nYour project is a large-scale undertaking that you will design and complete, usually in a group of 2 or 3, over the course of the semester. Your project should usually involve some combination of data collection, implementation, research of related work, experimentation, deployment, or theory work (but not necessarily all components). Projects are expected to demonstrate deep engagement with both the course content and the problem selected.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Reflections\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the course, you’ll write a process reflection describing your aspirations for the course—what you want to learn and achieve, and how you’d like to be assessed against your goals. We’ll have a second process reflection mid-way through the course that will allow you to reflect on your progress toward your objectives and consider changing direction if needed. At the end of the course, you’ll write a summary reflection on your learning, accomplishment, and engagement with the class. This is also the place where you’ll propose your final letter grade.
