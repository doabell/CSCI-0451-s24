        "# Introduction: Unsupervised Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "So far in this course, we've considered the *supervised* learning framework. In the supervised framework, we have a matrix of predictive features $\\mX \\in \\R^{n\\times p}$ and a vector of targets $\\vy \\in \\R^n$. Our aim is to find a function $f:\\R^p\\rightarrow \\R$ such that $f(\\vx) \\approx y$; that is, $f$ can be used to make reasonable predictions of a new target $y$ on the basis of new predictors $\\vx$.   \n",
        "\n",
        "**Unsupervised learning** refers to machine learning techniques in which we do **not** have access to any targets $\\vy$. Instead, we only have the features $\\mX$. In general, the aim of unsupervised learning is not to make predictions, but rather to \"find some structure\" in the features $\\mX$. \n",

        "\n",
        "## Dimensionality Reduction\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, dimensionality reduction is the task of identifying similar or related *features* (columns of $\\mX$). This often allows us to identify patterns in the data that we wouldn't be able to spot without algorithmic help. Dimensionality reduction is our topic for this lecture, and we'll discuss clustering in the next one. \n",
        "\n",
        "# Matrix Factorization Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many approaches for dimensionality reduction. Here, we're going to consider *matrix factorization methods*. Broadly speaking, in matrix factorization, we aim to write $\\mX \\approx \\mU \\mW$ for some matrices $\\mU$ and $\\mW$, usually subject to some constraints on these matrices. One constraint is direct: if $\\mX \\in \\R^{n \\times p}$, then we must have $\\mU \\in \\R^{n \\times k}$ and $\\mW \\in \\R^{k\\times p}$ for some value of $k$. We sometimes think of $k$ as a *latent dimension* for the problem, and aim to find a value of $k \\ll p$. The smaller $k$ is, the more we have simplified our data, but small values of $k$ may cause us to lose a lot of interesting structure that we might have wanted to capture. \n",
        "\n",
        "To specify a matrix factorization model, we need to make three main choices: \n",
        "\n",
        "1. What does \"$\\approx$\"  mean when we write  $\\mX \\approx \\mU \\mW$?\n",
        "2. What choice of $k$ will we use? \n",

        "\n",
        "In PCA, $\\mX \\approx \\mU \\mW$ means that $\\norm{\\mX - \\mU \\mW}_F$ is small, where $\\norm{\\cdot}_F$ is the *Frobenius norm*. The Frobenius norm of a matrix is just the square root of the sum of its squared entries: \n",

        "PCA is a fantastically powerful algorithm in a wide variety of settings, but it does have some important limitations. In this case, it can be difficult for us to interpret the results of PCA because some of the topics can be \"negatively involved\" in a chapter. That is, the words in that topic are \"especially absent\" from the chapter. This is confusing at best. So, we have a mismatch between what this specific matrix factorization method does and our interpretability needs. This is a very common situation, and is one of the most frequent motivators of new methods.
