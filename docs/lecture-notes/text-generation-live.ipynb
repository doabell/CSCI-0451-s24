Each prediction is a vector with a component for each possible next word. Let's call this vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.

[Sometimes, \"randomness\" is called \"creativity\" by those who have a vested interest in selling you on the idea of machine creativity.]{.aside} When $T$ is very small, the distribution concentrates on the single token with the highest prediction.
