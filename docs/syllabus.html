<h1>Readings</h1>
<p>It is not necessary for you to purchase any books for this course. We will have regular readings from a few different texts, with the most frequent one being:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ciml.info/"><em>A Course In Machine Learning</em></a> by Hal Daumé III.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following resources cover similar topics to our core readings at a similar level. If something doesn’t click for you in our core reading, you may want to check the treatment in one of these resources.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openeclass.panteion.gr/modules/document/file.php/PMS152/LEARNING/Abu-Mostafa%20Yaser%20S.%2C%20Malik%20Magdon-Ismail%2C%20Hsuan-Tien%20Lin%20%282012%29%20--%20Learning%20From%20Data_%20A%20short%20course.pdf"><em>Learning From Data</em></a> by Yaser Abu-Mostafa, Malik Magdon-Ismail, and Hsuan-Tien Lin.</li>
<li><a href="http://ema.cri-info.cm/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019BurkovTheHundred-pageMachineLearning.pdf"><em>The Hundred Page Machine Learning Book</em></a> by Andriy Burkov.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will also sometimes draw readings from the following sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05242"><em>Patterns, Predictions, and Actions: A Story About Machine Learning</em></a> by Mortiz Hardt and Benjamin Recht.</li>
<li><a href="https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html"><em>Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction</em></a> by Kevin Patrick Murphy.</li>
<li><a href="https://fairmlbook.org/pdf/fairmlbook.pdf"><em>Fairness and Machine Learning</em></a> by Solon Barocas, Moritz Hardt, and Arvind Narayanan.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following books are relatively advanced. I’ll often suggest additional readings from these books for students who are interested in diving deeper, especially into theoretical considerations.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf"><em>Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</em></a> by Christopher Bishop. Recommended for students who have taken a course in probability. </li>
<li><a href="https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf"><em>The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction</em></a> by Trevor Hastie, Rob Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman. A more statistical perspective on many of the same problems that we will study.</li>
<li><a href="https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf"><em>Mathematics for Machine Learning</em></a> by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong</li>
</ul>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">In case you’re wondering, I primarily learned out of Bishop and Hastie et al.</span></div><section id="social-annotation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="social-annotation">Social Annotation</h2>
<p>A an extremely useful way for you to engage with the readings is to make comments, ask questions, and answer questions about them <strong><em>as you are reading</em></strong>. For this reason, I’ll be providing most links to readings through <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/">Hypothes.is</a>. You’ll be able to make marginal comments and view the marginal comments of others. I’ll also regularly be checking on your annotations to see what questions might have come up with the readings.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-will-class-time-look-like">What Will Class Time Look Like?</h2>
<p>My plan is for most class periods to look like a “lecture sandwich:”</p>
<ul>
<li>10 to 15 minutes of a <strong>warmup activity</strong> that addresses the recent lectures and readings.</li>
<li>40-50 minutes of <strong>lecture</strong>, punctuated by short activities and breaks.</li>
<li>10-15 minutes of a <strong>closing activity</strong> that helps us get solid with the day’s content.</li>
</ul>
<section id="the-warmup-activity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-warmup-activity">The Warmup Activity</h3>
<p>On most days, we’ll have a warmup activity. The warmup activity will usually ask you to engage with the readings and complete a small amount of work <strong>ahead of class time</strong>. This could be a short piece of writing, a math problem, or an implementation of a Python function.</p>
<p>Each day, a few students will be randomly selected to present their work to a small group of peers. It’s ok to ask for help or even pass if you’re not feeling confident in your solution, but you should plan to at least make a good attempt at the warmup before every class period. Your participation on the warmup activity is an important aspect of presence in the course, and I’ll ask you to reflect on it when proposing your course grade.</p>

<li>Periodically throughout the semester, you will complete reflection activities to help you take stock of your learning and achievement in the course. In your final activity at the end of the semester, you’ll make a proposal for your letter grade in the course, and support it with evidence of your learning. You and I will then meet to discuss how the course went for you, using your reflection activity and proposal as a starting point. In this conversation, you and I will agree on your final letter grade for the course, which I will then submit to the registrar.</li>

<section id="why-collaborative-grading" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-collaborative-grading">Why Collaborative Grading?</h2>
<p>Because grading is broken! Traditional points-based grading is ineffective at both (a) accurately measuring student learning and (b) motivating students to learn. I broadly agree with Jesse Stommel when he <a href="https://www.jessestommel.com/why-i-dont-grade/">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Agency, dialogue, self-actualization, and social justice are not possible in a hierarchical system that pits teachers against students and encourages competition by ranking students against one another. Grades (and institutional rankings) are currency for a capitalist system that reduces teaching and learning to a mere transaction. Grading is a massive co-ordinated effort to take humans out of the educational process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d prefer to just not give you grades at all. But, Middlebury says I have to, and so my aim is to instead put the process of grading under your control to the greatest extent that I reasonably can.</p>

<td class="syllabus-description-table-header">
<b>Blog Posts</b>
</td>

<td class="syllabus-description-table-entry">
Blog posts are the primary way in which you will demonstrate your understanding of course content. Blog posts usually involve: written explanation of some relevant theory; implementation one or more algorithms according to written specifications; performing experiments to test the performance of the implementations; and communicating findings in a professional way. Some blog posts will be more like short essays than problem sets or programming assignments. Your blog posts will be hosted on your own public website (which you will create). This website will serve as your <strong>portfolio</strong> for the course.<br>

<tr>

<td class="syllabus-description-table-header">
<b>Project</b>
</td>

<td class="syllabus-description-table-entry">
Your project is a large-scale undertaking that you will design and complete, usually in a group of 2 or 3, over the course of the semester. Your project should usually involve some combination of data collection, implementation, research of related work, experimentation, deployment, or theory work (but not necessarily all components). Projects are expected to demonstrate deep engagement with both the course content and the problem selected.

<td class="syllabus-description-table-header">
<b>Process Reflections</b>
</td>

<td class="syllabus-description-table-entry">
At the beginning of the course, you’ll write a process reflection describing your aspirations for the course—what you want to learn and achieve, and how you’d like to be assessed against your goals. We’ll have a second process reflection mid-way through the course that will allow you to reflect on your progress toward your objectives and consider changing direction if needed. At the end of the course, you’ll write a summary reflection on your learning, accomplishment, and engagement with the class. This is also the place where you’ll propose your final letter grade. <br> <br> I’ll usually give you written feedback on your process reflections. We’ll also meet at the end of the course to discuss your final reflection and agree on your letter grade for the course.

You may have some topic or idea that especially interests you and which you want to explore.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="best-by-dates">Best-By Dates</h2>
<p>While we don’t have formal due dates, there is a benefit to keeping yourself on a schedule. It’s best to complete assignments close to the time when we covered the corresponding content in class, and it’s important for your wellbeing not to let work pile up. I’ll provide “best-by” dates for all assignments. These are my <strong>recommendations</strong> for when you should submit the first versions of these assignments to me for feedback.</p>

<section id="feedback" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feedback">Feedback</h2>
<p>I won’t “grade” your individual assignments, but our course team and I will offer you feedback about what I thought was successful and where you can improve. My general expectation is that you will often (though not always) revise your work in response to feedback and resubmit it. <strong>Revising in response to feedback is one of the single most effective ways for you to deepen your learning</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ll usually describe the importance of revisions on your assignment using one of the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No revisions suggested</strong>: you’ve done great work and should focus on the next thing.</li>
<li><strong>Revisions useful</strong>: you have opportunities for improvement on this assignment, but focusing on the next topic or assignment may be a better use of your time—use your judgment.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Revisions encouraged</strong>: the best use of your time is to respond to feedback and resubmit, rather than moving on to the next assignment.</li>
<li><strong>Incomplete</strong>: the assignment isn’t sufficiently complete for it to be used as evidence of your learning.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-work-do-you-need-to-do">What Work Do You Need To Do?</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the semester, you’ll write a process letter that will outline what you’d like to learn and achieve in the course. It’s ok if you don’t meet all your aspirations by the end of the course. To help guide you in your goal-setting and work-planning, I do have some general expectations.</p>
<p>I am likely to consider your time in my course to be highly successful if you do <strong>at least one</strong> of the following things:</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">Time spent being stuck doesn’t count as “productive hours” – get help if you need it!</span></div></div>
<ul>
<li>You complete almost all assignments with a high degree of quality, including revising in response to my feedback.</li>
<li>You spend on average <strong>10 productive hours</strong> of work time on this course outside of class.</li>
<li>You complete many assignments that I give you, and also propose and complete alternative work that demonstrates your learning and achievement.</li>

<p>This course asks you to set your own goals and motivate yourself to achieve them. Neither of these tasks are easy. It’s ok to mess up every now and then – we all do! The real question is whether you’re going to look at mistakes and make time to reflect on what to do next time.</p>

<p>I am assuming that you remember most of MATH 0200 and CSCI 0200. It’s ok if you haven’t memorized every single fact. What I need is for you to be ready to rapidly look up what you need so that you won’t be slowed down by math along the way.</p>

You don’t need to have memorized everything here, but most of it should look familiar.</li>
<li>Probability is not a formal requirement for CSCI 0451, but some probability can certainly be useful. To brush up on some basics, I suggest Chapter 2 of <em><a href="https://probability4datascience.com/">Introduction to Probability for Data Science</a></em> by Stanley Chan. This treatment may be a little more advanced than what you learned in CSCI 0200, but you should recognize many of the main ideas.</li>

<p>If you ever find yourself temporarily in need of a laptop, the Computer Science department has 10 rotating Dell laptops available to our students. These come pre-installed with software for most of the courses in the major. They are available to be loaned out short-term or long-term based on your need (as determined by you). To request a laptop for <strong>short-term use</strong> (like a single class period), email me ahead of time.</p>
<p><strong>On Long-Term Use</strong>: College policy has changed recently to include the expectation that every student have a laptop available. The college provides laptops to those who need them where “need” is based on Student Financial Services calculations. If you anticipate needing a laptop for the whole term, we encourage you to inquire with Student Financial Services and the library first due to our smaller pool of equipment. However, our department commits to meeting the needs of every student, so do not be afraid to reach out if you believe you need one of our laptops for any length of time.</p>

<section id="masks" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="masks">Masks Are Required in CSCI 0451</h3>
<p>The Computer Science Department policy states that:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We in the Computer Science department value a safe learning and working environment for all. While we can’t eliminate the risks associated with COVID-19, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2014564118">evidence suggests</a> that widespread masking can significantly reduce the transmission and severity of disease.&nbsp;In order to protect the health of our community, the CS department recommends that students and faculty wear masks in CS learning spaces, including classrooms, office hours, and public areas.&nbsp;We acknowledge the College policy gives instructors the final say over classroom masking requirements, and expect all students to respect instructors’ stated policies in each course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In alignment with this policy, <strong>I require you to wear masks in class and office hours.</strong> I encourage you to wear masks during help sessions and at all other times when you are inside 75 Shannon Street.</p>
<p>If you arrive in class without a mask, I will offer you one. I will expect you to either wear it or excuse yourself from class that day.</p>

<section id="academic-integrity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>Briefly, academic integrity means that you assume responsibility for ensuring that <strong>the work you submit demonstrates your learning and understanding</strong>.</p>
<p>To be frank, it’s pretty easy to act without integrity (i.e.&nbsp;cheat) in this course. First, there’s a lot of solution code for machine learning tasks in Python online. Second, I’m literally asking you all to post your assignments publicly online. So, there are lots of opportunities to turn in assignments without actually doing the learning that those assignments are designed to offer you.</p>
<p>I assume that both of us want you to learn some cool stuff. Cheating stops you from doing that, and ultimately wastes both your time and mine. I won’t be vigorously hunting for academic integrity violations, but I may ask you to discuss code or theory with me in class or in our meetings. If I notice you struggling to explain code that you submitted for feedback, I may have questions.</p>
<p>Trust me. Neither of us want this.</p>
