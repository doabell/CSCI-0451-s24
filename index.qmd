CSCI 0451, "Machine Learning," is an introductory course in computer science at Middlebury College. It is one of several ways in which you might begin a computer science major at Midd. It's also a great way for you to develop your computational skills to support other majors. 

The primary aim of CSCI 0145 is to help you build strong foundations in computational thinking and programming skills. We will cover a fair amount of the Python programming language. That said, our primary focus will be on reasoning, program design, and implementation principles rather than the details of Python programming.
