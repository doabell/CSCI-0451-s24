## Finals Period 

During the reading and final exam period, you'll meet with me 1-1 for about 15 minutes. The purpose of this meeting is to help us both reflect on your time in the course and agree on a final grade. 

## Due Dates

It's best to submit all work that you wish to demonstrate your learning by the time of our final meeting. However, I will accept and assess work submitted by the last day of the final exam period.
