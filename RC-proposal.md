Proposal for CSCI 0451: Machine Learning as a Responsible Computing Course

Machine learning underlies many modern automated decision processes, with applications that span many domains of human life. Many of us interact with multiple machine learning models over the course of a single day, with some of these models having potentially impactful effects on our experiences and opportunities. Much recent scholarship has shown ways in which these effects are inequitably distributed along axes of race, gender, and class. 

These considerations make explicit engagement with the topic of Responsible Computing an imperative component of machine learning pedagogy. My upcoming offering of the course includes, as a draft semester-spanning learning objective,

> Students will interrogate sources of bias and harm in machine learning models, especially with regard to gender, race, and class. 

This objective is intentionally relatively abstract. Possible learning activities and demonstrations toward this objective include: 

- Instruction and activities on auditing algorithms. 
- Classroom discussion of well-known case studies on bias in machine learning models. 
- Programming activities and data analysis from instances of bias in models. 
- Readings and written reflections on landmark and survey papers or books on algorithmic bias. 
- Readings, discussion, and critique of formal criteria for fairness in machine learning models. 
- Analysis of bias in student-generated models (e.g. word-embedding layers in 
text classifiers).
- Engagement with expert tech ethicists through talks or classroom visits. 
- Ethics statements on cumulative projects. 

All of these demonstrations offer feedback opportunities, including: 

- Instructor comments on code, data analyses, and project deliverables. 
- Dialogic annotations on readings through web commenting platforms. 
- Student self-assessments of learning and engagement.
